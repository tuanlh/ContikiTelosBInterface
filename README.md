# ContikiTelosBInterface
A hack to simulate proper led layout in contiki simulator for TelosB mote

This file should replace the contiki/tools/cooja/apps/mspsim/src/se/sics/cooja/mspmote/interfaces/SkyLED.java file
Install contiki as normal and put in this replacement.  Application interface will be updated on next build of the simulator.
